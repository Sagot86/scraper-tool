Task:

Create a console program in Java that can recursively traverse and download https://tretton37.com and save it to disk while keeping the online file structure. Show download progress in the console.
Focus on building a solid application that showcases your overall coding and Java skills, donâ€™t get caught up in technical details like html link extraction (a simple regex is totally fine).

On top of the basics, we do appreciate it if your program displays a good use of asynchronicity,
parallelism and threading. During the technical evaluation we will discuss the way you chose to solve the code assignment, as well as factors like:

- Overall code quality
- Readability and maintainability
- Understanding of the requirements of the assignment
- Problem solving and creativity
- Testing
- Quality aspects other than production code
- Polymorphism and object oriented aspects of the code (if applicable in the language)
